-- guide users through your business processes with flow builder


26 dec 2020
-- combine the power of process builder and flow builder
------------process builder cant post to a community feed, submit for approval, delete records, perform complex logic or create a bunch of relations of a bunch of records at once.  to do these things, configure a complex functionality flow and  apply that flow action to your process or write an Apex which you then add to the process.
first you build the flow, then call the flow in the build process.

auto launched flows are not screens (which require user input) autolaunched flows are called from from backend things like Apex.
